In this interview, we typically want to see a lot more working code - can you try to complete

a) user registration with password encrypting and auth with JWT,
b) all routes for workspaces, boards, and todos (and test them in the video to make sure they work), and
c) make sure that you are taking the logged in user into account in each of the routes.
